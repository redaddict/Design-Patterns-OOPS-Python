    "Abstract methods need to be overridden in the subclasses that extend the abstract (template) class.\n",
    "Hook methods normally have empty bodies in the abstract class. Subclasses can optionally\n",
    "override the hook methods to create custom implementations.\n",
    "So, what you have, is an abstract class, with several types of methods, being the main template\n",
    "method, and a combination of abstract and/or hooks, that can be extended by different subclasses\n",
    "that all have the option of customizing the behavior of the template class without changing its\n",
    "underlying algorithm structure.\n",
    "Template methods are useful to help you factor out common behavior within your library classes.\n",
    "Note that this pattern describes the behavior of a method and how its inner method calls behave. \n",
    "Hooks are default behavior and can be overridden. They are normally empty by default.\n",

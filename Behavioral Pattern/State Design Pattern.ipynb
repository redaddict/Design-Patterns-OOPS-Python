    "Not to be confused with object state, i.e., one of more attributes that can be copied as a snapshot,the State Pattern is more concerned about changing the handle of an object's method dynamically.\n",
    "This makes an object itself more dynamic and may reduce the need of many conditional statements.\n",
    "Instead of storing a value in an attribute, and then then using conditional statements within an objects method to produce different output, a subclass is assigned as a handle instead. The object/context doesn't need to know about the inner working of the assigned subclass that the task was\n",
    "delegated to. \n",
    "In the state pattern, the behavior of an objects state is encapsulated within the subclasses that are dynamically assigned to handle it\n"

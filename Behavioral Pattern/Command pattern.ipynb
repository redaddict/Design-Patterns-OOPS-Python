    "The Command pattern is a behavioral design pattern, in which an abstraction exists between an object that invokes a command, and the object that performs it.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g., a button will call the Invoker, that will call a pre-registered Command, that the Receiver will perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Concrete Class will delegate a request to a command object, instead of implementing the request directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a command design pattern allows you to separate concerns and to solve problems of the concerns independently of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g., logging the execution of a command and its outcome.\n",

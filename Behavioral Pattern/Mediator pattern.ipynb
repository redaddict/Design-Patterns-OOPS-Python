    "Objects communicate through the Mediator rather than directly with each other.\n",
    "As a system evolves and becomes larger and supports more complex functionality and business rules, the problem of communicating between these components becomes more complicated to understand and manage. \n",
    "It may be beneficial to refactor your system to centralize some or all of its functionality via some kind of mediation process.\n",
    "The mediator pattern is similar to creating a Facade pattern between your classes and processes.\n",
    "Except the Mediator is expected to transact data both ways between two or more other classes or processes that would normally interact directly with each other.\n",
    "Colleagues now will send and receive requests via a Mediator object rather than directly between each other. The Mediator is like a router in this case, but allows you to add extra programmatic functionality and also give the option of creating other kinds of colleagues that could utilize the communications in new ways."

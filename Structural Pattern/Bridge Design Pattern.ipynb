    "The Bridge pattern is similar to the Adapter pattern except in the intent that you developed it. \n",
    "The Bridge is an approach to refactor already existing code, whereas the Adapter creates an interface on top of existing code through existing available means without refactoring any existing code or interfaces.\n",
    "The motivation for converting your code to the Bridge pattern is that it may be tightly coupled. \n",
    "There is logic and abstraction close together that is limiting your choices in how you can extend your\n",
